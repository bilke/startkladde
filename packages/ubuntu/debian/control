Description: launch logging for flying clubs
 startkladde is a program for logging launches at airfields or glider sites.
 Its main audience are flying clubs which need to record the data for legal
 reasons and for billing.
 A web interface (called sk_web) is available to allow pilots and clubs to
 access the data.
