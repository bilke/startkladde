0->1:
  - convert to utf8/utf8_unicode_ci
  - transfer from ... to ..._temp, then rename ..._temp to ...
  - create towpilot columns
  - rename columns to english
  - remove bwlv column
  - add id to user
  - add launch types
  - innodb instead of myisam (?)
  - landed/... as flag or as time!=null?
  - change 0 time to null?
  - store date of flight and times instead of datetimes? time zone safety?
    => no, b/c start and landing can be on different utc date
       when effective date stored, updating trouble when mode changed 
  - meaning of null values in general
  - constraints (used person may not be deleted) in database
  - proper data types
  - standardize enum types
  - remove distinction between 1/2 seated training
  - ..., see tickets
  
Later:
  - towflight as separate flight?
