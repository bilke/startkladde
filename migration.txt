- add launch methods
- ..., see tickets

Possible changes:
	- replace flight.status with individual flags (or as time!=null?)
	- add users.id
	- towflight as separate flight?
    - change 0 time to null?
	- foreign key constraints?
    - standardize enum types (database enum types?)
	- remove distinction between 1/2 seated training
	- remove unique constraint from plane.registration (and add active flag?)

Notes:
	- don't store date separately because takeoff and landing can be on
	  different utc dates, storing the local date is bad, and storing the
	  effective date is complicated and error prone on updates
