  - rename tables and columns
  - change 0 time to null?
  - meaning of null values in general
  - constraints (used person may not be deleted) in database?
  - standardize enum types (database enum types?)
  - Flights:
    - landed/... as flag or as time!=null?
    - store date of flight and times instead of datetimes? time zone safety?
      => no, b/c start and landing can be on different utc date
         when effective date stored, updating trouble when mode changed 
    - remove distinction between 1/2 seated training
    - remove column club, editierbar
  - Launch method:
    - add launch methods
  - Planes
    - remove unique constraint from plane.registration (and active flag?)
  - ..., see tickets

Later:
	- add users.id
	- towflight as separate flight?
