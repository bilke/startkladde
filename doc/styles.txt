Use KDE styles on non-KDE systems:
You need:
  - The style files (for example from /usr/lib/kde3/plugins/styles/)
  - libkdefx.so
  - The version of QT used to build the plugin must match the version of QT
    used to build the program (the build key must match, see
    http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/plugins-howto.html).

The plugins can be placed in the styles subdirectory of the program. If
libkdefx.* cannot be placed in the system library directory, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
can be used.

Apparently, qtconfig can not be used to select the additional styles.
